We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement submitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this statement is to outline the business’ systems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular focus on risk areas within our supply chain.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems.\r\n\r\nOur headquarters, manufacturing and supply facility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\r\nDecor Systems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",

We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement submitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this statement is to outline the business’ systems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular focus on risk areas within our supply chain.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems.\r\n\r\nOur headquarters, manufacturing and supply facility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\r\nDecor Systems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",

We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement submitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this statement is to outline the business’ systems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular focus on risk areas within our supply chain.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems.\r\n\r\nOur headquarters, manufacturing and supply facility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\r\nDecor Systems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",

We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement submitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this statement is to outline the business’ systems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular focus on risk areas within our supply chain.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems.\r\n\r\nOur headquarters, manufacturing and supply facility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\r\nDecor Systems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",

We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",

    "modern_slavery_comments": "Decor Systems is committed to ethical business practices and the\r\neradication of modern slavery in all its forms. We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating\r\nmodern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION \r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement\r\nsubmitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018. The purpose of this statement is to outline the business’\r\nsystems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human\r\ntrafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour. Decor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular\r\nfocus on risk areas within our supply chain. \r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE \r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems. Our headquarters, manufacturing and supply\r\nfacility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne. \r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS \r\nDecorSystems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for\r\nover 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products,\r\nprofessional services, experience, and industry knowledge. With a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout\r\nAustralia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions. Decor\r\nSystems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply\r\nagreements in place. Our manufacturing facility produces custom and\r\nmade-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia. Our importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no\r\ncustomisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian\r\nsuppliers. \r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\n\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical\r\nprocurement and oppose slavery in all its forms. Policies and risk\r\nmanagement processes have been implemented to identify and\r\naddress the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes\r\nroutine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that\r\nencompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including\r\nmodern slavery. Within this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified\r\ntwo areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the\r\nconstruction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers\r\nwhere materials are imported from overseas have a medium\r\ngeographic and entity risk. \r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION\r\nPROCESSES \r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of\r\nmodern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers. Nevertheless,\r\nDecor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human\r\ntrafficking within the supply chain and has established internal\r\nprocesses to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply\r\ncontract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to\r\nsupply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation\r\nand best practice. Ensuring that Decor Systems do not purchase\r\nmaterials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any\r\nexisting suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding\r\nPrinciples, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those\r\nsupply arrangements. Staff training within Decor Systems direct\r\nsupply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to\r\nengagement of suppliers. Existing suppliers are audited in line with\r\nDecor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS \r\n\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus\r\nareas will be: Further refining our procurement processes and\r\ntraining our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to\r\nthe Decor Systems board.

It promotes renewable, bio-based resources, minimises synthetics and foregrounds the uniquely climate-beneficial properties of hemp & flax. \r\n------------------------------------------\r\nBio Tile’s greatest impact comes from rejecting the use of fossil fuel primary materials in favour of those with low embodied carbon, paving the way for just material transitions. Its utilisation of renewable agricultural waste inputs and design for disassembly integrates circular processes, and its demonstrated sound attenuation and biophilic attributes elevate human comfort and well-being.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nIn a fundamental shift towards a resource-efficient cycle, Bio Tile highlights one of the most climate-beneficial industrial fibre crops on the planet: the rapidly CO2-absorbing hemp plant. One hectare of industrial hemp can absorb approximately 15 tonnes of CO2, four times more than young forests, making it a powerful tool in carbon emission reduction. Both hemp and flax are annually renewable, require minimal resources, and do not compete with food production. Combining this resource efficiency with the use of renewable energy for production and the choice of a plant-derived biopolymer for structure demonstrates the kind of best practice manufacturing processes the wider industry can adopt. This data is in the process of being quantified through a Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) and creation of an EPD.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nBio Tile was developed with the principles of biodesign, which seeks to connect people with nature for improved well-being. Its raw texture and earthy tones reflect the imperfections found in nature; the gentle topography of the Ellipse shape acts as both a diffuser to break up sound waves, and an element of biophilic harmony.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdditional certifications or product literature may be available on request – please contact your Instyle Sales Representative for more details.",

Plantations also support a reasonable degree of biodiversity.\r\nWood is a renewable resource\r\nVeneer is one of the most environmentally efficient and economical ways to use beautiful timbers because one cubic metre of veneer can cover more than 1,000 m2 of panel surface\r\n\r\nThe Briggs Group is committed to the responsible use of the world’s resources. We are proud to have pioneered the use of Australian sustainable hardwoods for veneer, harvested in accordance with passing the strict environmental guidelines that are required by Government. By law, Australian State Forest land cannot be permanently cleared; it must always be replanted or regenerated.  Sustainable harvest means that the amount of timber that grows back each year is greater than, or equal to, the amount harvested. Furthermore, such forests are managed in accordance with strict laws and regulations to protect biodiversity, endangered species, water quality and other environmental values.  Additionally, all the Australian veneer that we get sliced, and all the veneer that we import, is checked under our Due Diligence program as being legally harvested.",

We firmly believe in upholding human rights, promoting social responsibility, and maintaining transparency in our operations and supply chains. This Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking, the steps we have taken to prevent its occurrence, and our plans for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is the second Modern Slavery Statement submitted by Decor Systems. Decor Systems has elected to publish this statement voluntarily, as informed by the Modern Slavery Act 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this statement is to outline the business’ systems for identifying the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain and implementing processes to minimise any risk.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems recognise that slavery and human trafficking can occur in many forms including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, forced marriage and deceptive methods of recruiting labour.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems are committed to operating responsibly and maintaining ethical standards across our operations, with a particular focus on risk areas within our supply chain.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\nDecor Systems is a family owned Australian owned and operated vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier and retailer of architectural acoustic panel systems.\r\n\r\nOur headquarters, manufacturing and supply facility located in Glendenning, NSW. Decor Systems maintains offices in Brisbane and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\r\nDecor Systems is committed to the superior design, production and supply of quality products and services. We have been in the business for over 50 years and offer an extensive range of innovative products, professional services, experience, and industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith a growing team of Sales and Project Consultants located throughout Australia, , a modern manufacturing and supply facility and an international sourcing team, Decor Systems has a valued reputation for reliably delivering state-of-the-art architectural solutions.\r\n\r\nDecor Systems’ supply chain includes both local and overseas suppliers with whom the business has established, long-standing supply agreements in place.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facility produces custom and made-to-order products, sourcing raw materials and componentry from tier one suppliers mostly located in Australia.\r\n\r\nOur importing division sources and assembles materials that requires little or no customisation, with raw materials sourced largely from suppliers located in Germany, USA and Latvia, as well as some local Australian suppliers.\r\n\r\nADDRESSING THE RISK OF MODERN SLAVERY PRACTICES\r\nThe Decor Systems executive team are committed to ethical procurement and oppose slavery in all its forms.\r\n\r\nPolicies and risk management processes have been implemented to identify and address the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. This includes routine supplier evaluation and supply chain mapping that encompasses a range of environmental and ethical risks, including modern slavery.\r\n\r\nWithin this supply chain analysis, BFX has identified two areas of risk. First, a generally low risk of modern slavery in the construction supplies sector. Second, some second-tier suppliers where materials are imported from overseas have a medium geographic and entity risk.\r\n\r\nDUE DILIGENCE AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES\r\nTo date, Decor Systems has had no reported incidents of modern slavery or breaches by its overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Decor Systems recognises the inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain and has established internal processes to guide supplier selection and tendering, including:\r\n\r\nConsideration of certain factors before a supplier is awarded a supply contract. For example, the potential supplier’s reputation, ability to supply, integrity, financial strength and compliance with legislation and best practice.\r\nEnsuring that Decor Systems do not purchase materials from suppliers that breach the UN Guiding Principles. If any existing suppliers are found to have breached the UN Guiding Principles, Decor Systems will take immediate steps to reassess those supply arrangements.\r\nStaff training within Decor Systems direct supply chain,in which supplier evaluation is conducted prior to engagement of suppliers.\r\nExisting suppliers are audited in line with Decor Systems GECA, FSC and Illegal Logging Audit requirements.\r\nFUTURE COMMITMENTS\r\nOver the next year, Decor Systems focus areas will be:\r\n\r\nFurther refining our procurement processes and training our procurement team with best practice initiatives.\r\nReviewing identified risk areas in the supply chain and reporting to the Decor Systems board.\r\nDavid Faulkes\r\nChief Executive Officer",
