As a family business, we consider all our employees as part of the family and treat them like that. 95% of our workforce with experience of 10 years stayed with us and plans to stay. We attract talent from local area as well as from all over the country. Those values are being extended not only to our own employees, but to our partners and suppliers as well. We have practices in place to confirm and verify the fair treatment of labour in all the mines of raw materials.\r\nAs much as we try to verify the origin of materials and the practice of fair labour with respect to human rights, we also urge our customers to take that into consideration when choosing which material to supply. As a family business, we are terrified and truly disappointed to find out about horrible circumstances that labourers must work in some stone quarries, with child labour as not an exception. ILO identified up to 1 million children working in mines and quarries around the world. (https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/lang--en/index.htm) We do encourage our customers, to make a choice not only for sustainable and environmentally friendly products, but also to make a conscious choice with respect to other families from all over the world.\r\nAs an organization, we are actively working to combat these unethical practices, and we urge the Australian A&D industry to be conscious of their sourcing decisions to prevent supporting such practices in the supply chain.",

Plantations also support a reasonable degree of biodiversity.\r\nWood is a renewable resource\r\nVeneer is one of the most environmentally efficient and economical ways to use beautiful timbers because one cubic metre of veneer can cover more than 1,000 m2 of panel surface\r\n\r\nThe Briggs Group is committed to the responsible use of the world’s resources. We are proud to have pioneered the use of Australian sustainable hardwoods for veneer, harvested in accordance with passing the strict environmental guidelines that are required by Government. By law, Australian State Forest land cannot be permanently cleared; it must always be replanted or regenerated.  Sustainable harvest means that the amount of timber that grows back each year is greater than, or equal to, the amount harvested. Furthermore, such forests are managed in accordance with strict laws and regulations to protect biodiversity, endangered species, water quality and other environmental values.  Additionally, all the Australian veneer that we get sliced, and all the veneer that we import, is checked under our Due Diligence program as being legally harvested.",
