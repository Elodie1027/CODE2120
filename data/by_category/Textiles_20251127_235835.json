Elmo has achieved CO2 neutrality in energy use by utilising 100% renewable electricity and biofuel-based steam for heating. They enhance sustainability further by implementing a circular heating energy approach, selling back the hot condensate generated from biofuel steam to the heating supplier, which reduces energy consumption in steam production.

Our efforts to reduce \r\noperational carbon include the installation of rooftop solar cells at our plants in Sydney and The Netherlands, and the installation \r\nof LED lighting in our Sydney plant and office..\r\nOur Australian production facility in 2023, has moved beyond climate neutral goals becoming carbon positive with the expansion\r\nof the existing solar panel system. The facility now produces a large surplus of renewable energy, offsetting more energy than the\r\nsite consumes.\r\nFor more information visit: https://verosol.com.au/product-stewardship/",

Then, chrome-tanned leathers vary – with pure anilines, those not having pigment on their surface perhaps taking between 5-10 years, and pigmented -finish articles maybe taking up to 50-100 years.  But if we’re looking at landfills and the different types, that will also have an effect.  Any landfill which allows air and moisture to reach the leather material will accelerate or at least mean biodegrading happens most quickly, but if the leather were deep in a landfill, and not being subjected to much air or moisture that leather would only biodegrade extremely slowly.",
