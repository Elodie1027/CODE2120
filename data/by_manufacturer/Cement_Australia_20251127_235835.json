Low Carbon Cement is a blend of GP Cement, Fly Ash and proprietary additives to achieve a product that provides both a 30% carbon reduction relative to GP Cement, whilst also maintaining comparable strength performance and workability to GP Cement.  Cement Australia has already received positive feedback from a number of field trials across Melbourne indicating that there was no difference in performance to GP.  Low Carbon Cement complies with the Type GB requirements of Australian Standard AS3972 and will be supported by an independently verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD).  \r\n\r\nCement Australia is leading the construction industry with a clear solution to reduce embodied carbon in concrete and mortar without compromising on strength performance or compliance to Australian Standards, and support our societies need to decarbonisation and reach net zero emissions by 2050.",
