It's important to support local skills and economies and minimise transport across state lines. We currently work with partners in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. As part of this initiative, we have contracted Sydney based Circular Design Thinking to initiate a comprehensive supplier code of conduct which will set minimum standards and guidelines for our supply chain to follow. We recently introduced Digital Product Passports into our range also to provide transparency into our supply chain and to be able to provide waste and transport emissions data to our clients.
