It promotes renewable, bio-based resources, minimises synthetics and foregrounds the uniquely climate-beneficial properties of hemp & flax. \r\n------------------------------------------\r\nBio Tile’s greatest impact comes from rejecting the use of fossil fuel primary materials in favour of those with low embodied carbon, paving the way for just material transitions. Its utilisation of renewable agricultural waste inputs and design for disassembly integrates circular processes, and its demonstrated sound attenuation and biophilic attributes elevate human comfort and well-being.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nIn a fundamental shift towards a resource-efficient cycle, Bio Tile highlights one of the most climate-beneficial industrial fibre crops on the planet: the rapidly CO2-absorbing hemp plant. One hectare of industrial hemp can absorb approximately 15 tonnes of CO2, four times more than young forests, making it a powerful tool in carbon emission reduction. Both hemp and flax are annually renewable, require minimal resources, and do not compete with food production. Combining this resource efficiency with the use of renewable energy for production and the choice of a plant-derived biopolymer for structure demonstrates the kind of best practice manufacturing processes the wider industry can adopt. This data is in the process of being quantified through a Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) and creation of an EPD.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nBio Tile was developed with the principles of biodesign, which seeks to connect people with nature for improved well-being. Its raw texture and earthy tones reflect the imperfections found in nature; the gentle topography of the Ellipse shape acts as both a diffuser to break up sound waves, and an element of biophilic harmony.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdditional certifications or product literature may be available on request – please contact your Instyle Sales Representative for more details.",

Elmo has achieved CO2 neutrality in energy use by utilising 100% renewable electricity and biofuel-based steam for heating. They enhance sustainability further by implementing a circular heating energy approach, selling back the hot condensate generated from biofuel steam to the heating supplier, which reduces energy consumption in steam production.

Elmo has achieved CO2 neutrality in energy use by utilising 100% renewable electricity and biofuel-based steam for heating. They enhance sustainability further by implementing a circular heating energy approach, selling back the hot condensate generated from biofuel steam to the heating supplier, which reduces energy consumption in steam production.
