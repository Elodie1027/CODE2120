As part of our commitment to fair labor practices, we have third-party verified Modern Slavery Declarations (Level A GreenRate from Global Greentag), ensuring that our supply chain is free from any exploitative or unethical labor practices. These certifications and measures reflect our strong emphasis on social responsibility and equity, both within our organization and throughout our supply chain. We value the practice of fair labour. As a family business, we consider all our employees as part of the family and treat them like that. 95% of our workforce with experience of 10 years stayed with us and plans to stay. We attract talent from local area as well as from all over the country. Those values are being extended not only to our own employees, but to our partners and suppliers as well. We have practices in place to confirm and verify the fair treatment of labour in all the mines of raw materials.\r\nAs much as we try to verify the origin of materials and the practice of fair labour with respect to human rights, we also urge our customers to take that into consideration when choosing which material to supply. As a family business, we are terrified and truly disappointed to find out about horrible circumstances that labourers must work in some stone quarries, with child labour as not an exception. ILO identified up to 1 million children working in mines and quarries around the world. (https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/lang--en/index.htm) We do encourage our customers, to make a choice not only for sustainable and environmentally friendly products, but also to make a conscious choice with respect to other families from all over the world.\r\nAs an organization, we are actively working to combat these unethical practices, and we urge the Australian A&D industry to be conscious of their sourcing decisions to prevent supporting such practices in the supply chain.",
