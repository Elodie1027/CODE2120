Other alternatives to Equipotential Bonding FAIL due to simple wear and tear, exposure to UV radiation, other harsh weather conditions and/or chemical process. One example are puported non conductive spigots that will be conductive if the grub screw caps are left out during installation, fall out at any other time or degrade for the same reasons already mentioned. These spigots will also be conductive if they are chipped, scratched or the coating degrades for the reasons already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe SENTINEL is the safer, superior, economical, time saving and inclusive alternative to Equipotential Bonding of extraneous conductive elements.",
