Here are some practical tips:\r\n\r\n1. Plan Ahead\r\nMeasure Accurately: Measure the area carefully to calculate the exact number of tiles needed, including cuts and potential wastage.\r\nPurchase Extra Strategically: Buy about 10-15% more tiles than calculated to account for breakage, cuts, or future repairs—but avoid overbuying.\r\nChoose the Right Tile Sizes: Opt for tile sizes that fit your space well to minimize cutting and waste.\r\n2. Optimize Layout\r\nDry Lay the Tiles: Lay out the tiles on the floor or wall before fixing them to identify the best layout and minimize cuts.\r\nStart from the Center: Begin tiling from the center of the room or focal point to ensure symmetrical cuts at the edges.\r\nPlan Cuts Strategically: Place cut tiles in less noticeable areas, such as corners or under furniture.\r\n3. Use Precision Cutting Tools\r\nInvest in quality tools like a tile cutter or wet saw to make accurate cuts and reduce breakage.\r\nPractice cutting on scrap tiles to avoid mistakes.\r\n4. Handle Tiles Properly\r\nAvoid rough handling to prevent breakage during transportation and installation.\r\nStore tiles on a flat surface in a safe area to reduce the risk of chipping or cracking.\r\n5. Minimize Breakage\r\nUse the correct adhesive and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure tiles stick securely without cracking.\r\nAvoid dropping heavy tools or materials on the tiles during installation.\r\n6. Recycle and Reuse\r\nSave usable offcuts for future projects or repairs.\r\nRepurpose broken tiles for mosaics or as fillers in other areas.\r\n7. Hire Professionals (if necessary)\r\nExperienced tile installers can reduce wastage significantly through proper techniques and efficient planning.",
