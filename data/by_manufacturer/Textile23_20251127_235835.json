By reducing waste, extending material life, and prioritising traceable, responsibly sourced fibres, Textile23 contributes to climate-conscious, socially responsible, and equitable design solutions for commercial, residential, and hospitality interiors.",

By repurposing fabric cores and saving packaging materials for multiple cycles, we significantly reduce waste and extend the life of our transport materials.\r\n\r\nWe are actively exploring opportunities to further increase the recycled content of our packaging and identify alternatives that align with our commitment to circularity, responsible sourcing, and sustainability throughout the supply chain.",
