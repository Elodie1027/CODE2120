Our efforts to reduce \r\noperational carbon include the installation of rooftop solar cells at our plants in Sydney and The Netherlands, and the installation \r\nof LED lighting in our Sydney plant and office..\r\nOur Australian production facility in 2023, has moved beyond climate neutral goals becoming carbon positive with the expansion\r\nof the existing solar panel system. The facility now produces a large surplus of renewable energy, offsetting more energy than the\r\nsite consumes.\r\nFor more information visit: https://verosol.com.au/product-stewardship/",
